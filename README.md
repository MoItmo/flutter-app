Getting Started
## Project Name: AI-Powered Expense Tracker
## Introduction
This project is an AI-powered expense tracker designed to help users automatically categorize their expenses and provide visual insights into their spending habits. It includes user management, machine learning integration, and analytics. Below, I’ll highlight the key features I’ve implemented and the plans for future improvements.

## Technologies Used
• Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-learn (for AI categorization) 
• Frontend: Flutter (for mobile app development) 
• Backend: Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore (for user authentication and data storage) 
• Analytics: fl_chart for visualizing spending habits using bar and pie charts

## What Was Done in the Project
## 1. User Management
• Implemented: I created a user authentication system using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and securely manage their account. This ensures data is securely stored and synced across devices.

## 2. Real-Time Data Syncing
• Implemented: I used Firebase Cloud Firestore to sync expense data in real-time, ensuring changes made on one device are reflected across all devices instantly.

## 3. Analytics and Reporting
• Implemented: I developed visual analytics to display spending habits using bar charts and pie charts, allowing users to easily track and visualize their expenses over time. • Additional: I also included a monthly spending summary feature, which gives users a quick overview of their expenses for the month.

## 4. Machine Learning Integration
• Implemented: I integrated an AI-powered categorization system that automatically categorizes expenses based on historical data and provides personalized financial tips to the user. • Additional: I also added an “Ask AI” feature, where users can interact with the AI for financial advice, such as asking how to save money or whether they are overspending in a particular category.

## 5. User Interface Improvements
• Additional: I focused on creating a simple, intuitive UI using Flutter. This includes an easy-to-navigate design that helps users log and view their expenses quickly, with minimal effort.

## Plans for Future
## Billing Subsystem:
• To Be Done: Implement a credit management system, where users can store credits and deduct credits based on certain actions or events within the system. This will involve creating functionality for adding credits, checking credit balances, and updating balances after each relevant event.

## Prediction Engine:
• To Be Done: Develop a prediction engine that uses machine learning models to predict outcomes or provide services to users. This will include the ability to track success rates and manage credit deductions accordingly.

## API Development:
• To Be Done: Build a REST API for managing user data, predictions, and credits. This API will allow users to interact with the system, manage their accounts, and access prediction functionalities. Advanced Analytics: • To Be Done: Extend the analytics functionality to track more detailed user activity, including prediction success rates, credits usage, and detailed reports on the system’s performance over time.
